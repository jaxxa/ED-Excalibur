The Laser Drilling system makes use of the shipboard weapon systems, directed at the surface of the planet to create a new or seal an existing Steam Geyser.
Once the system is Online, Laser Drill Targeting buildings can be requisitioned. 
When this building is deployed they will spend a short while scanning the underground topography to precisely calibrate the weapon systems. 
Once scanning is complete, and assuming that the ship possesses the considerable power reserves required for firing the weapon system the options to create or collapse a Geyser will be available. 
Selecting one of these will direct the weapon firing to commence and the geyser will be created or destroyed.
Use of the weapon systems in this manner, while not usually causing collateral damage will destroy the targeting building and has been known to start fires in the surrounding area that ground forces should be prepared to contain.
