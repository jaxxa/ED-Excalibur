# Overview

This mod attempts to bring together a number of my mods that deal in advanced technology together into a single unified mod with a logical explanation for the colony having access to substantially more advanced systems than they otherwise would, while also providing a more interesting way of obtaining these technologies than just long research times.


# Features of the Mod

When a Strange Signal is detected by your colony, it leads to symbiotic interactions with heavily damaged Ancient Starship as you assist them in bringing their systems back online from the brink of disaster in exchange for access to their advanced technology. 

Features:
* Shield Generators: Fortify areas of your colony from attack.
* Personal Shields: Create infrastructure to protect specific colonists and animals from damage.
* OmniGel: Growing and processing renewable resources.
* Transporters: Move people and materials over vast distances.
* Laser Drills: Drill deep into the surface to unlock the almost unlimited potential of Geothermal Energy.
* Power Transfer: Provide energy over vast distances.


# Manual 

Welcome members of the Enhanced Development Stella Navy (E.D.S.N.)
If you are reading this you have been selected for a most prestigious post, serving on the soon to be launched Experimental Command Carrier, the E.D.S.N. Prometheus.
Please take your time to familiarise yourself with the procedures and capabilities outlined in this manual. Standard shipboard operations that are consistent with existing EDSN fleet operations are not covered in this manual. This focuses on some of the unique features of the Prometheus, primarily its unique capabilities to provide support for ground based operations.


1. E.D.S.N. emergency protocols - (Starting the Quest)

In the event of a catastrophic failure occouring on the ship, the first priority should be restoring 

2. Research / Construction

3. First Contact

4. Power Up

5. Basic Repairs

6. Bringing Specific Systems Online

7. Shields 


8. Laser Drill

The Laser Drilling system makes use of the shipboard weapon systems, directed at the surface of the planet to create a new or seal an existing Steam Geyser.
Once the system is Online, Laser Drill Targeting buildings can be requisitioned. 
When this building is deployed they will spend a short while scanning the underground topography to precisely calibrate the weapon systems. 
Once scanning is complete, and assuming that the ship possesses the considerable power reserves required for firing the weapon system the options to create or collapse a Geyser will be available. 
Selecting one of these will direct the weapon firing to commence and the geyser will be created or destroyed.
Use of the weapon systems in this manner, while not usually causing collateral damage will destroy the targeting building and has been known to start fires in the surrounding area that ground forces should be prepared to contain.


9. Transporter

10. OmniGel
 
11. Power Transfer
